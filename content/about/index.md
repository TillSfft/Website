#### What's there to know?

I have been editing since 2017, but my love for movies started way earlier.
I have edited fiction, documentaries, advertisements, social content, and animation. A close creative collaboration with the team is important to me, and I like being involved early on in production. Keeping my edit and setup well organised is as important to me as having a weekend.
